# DETECTION-OF-DDOS-ATTACKS-THROUGH-MACHINE-LEARNING
 With the expansion of the cyber world, new threats have emerged in the virtual environment. This work utilizes machine learning to detect DDoS attacks. The currently trained models were developed using two algorithms: Logistic Regression and Random Forest. Both were employed to identify the algorithm that provides the best performance security
